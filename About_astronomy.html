                <h2>What is Astronomy?</h2>
                <p>Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth’s <br>
                     atmosphere. That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes,<br>
                      like the Sun , the Moon , the planets, and the stars . It also includes <br>
                       objects we can only see with telescopes or other instruments, like <br>
                        faraway galaxies and tiny particles. And it even includes questions <br>
                        about things we can't see at all, like dark matter and dark energy .

                <h2>1. When we look up at the night sky, we see patterns and want to explain them</h2>
                <p>Early observers looking at the night sky noticed patterns in the stars . These 
                    patterns, which we call constellations, might<br>
                     appear to change place, but they 
                     don’t change shape. People around the world gave them names (like  Orion 
                      the hunter or Leo <br> the lion) and told stories about them. You may know some of 
                       these stories as myths, or as astrology. Astrology can be fun to <br>think about, but 
                       it’s different from astronomy. Astrology is not science! 
                        <br>
                    Early observers also noticed some bright objects in the sky that seem to wander <br>
                     around among the stars. The ancient Greek philosophers called these objects “planets,” <br>
                     which is Greek for “wanderers.” The planets are our near neighbors, and they do move. <br>
                     They orbit the Sun , just as Earth does.</p>

                <h2>3. Everything in space is moving all the time</h2>
                <p>You might feel like you’re sitting still, but you’re actually flying through space incredibly fast! That’s because Earth is carrying you like a spaceship. 

                    Earth is spinning. If you were standing on the equator, you and the spot under your feet would be rotating at a speed of about a thousand miles per hour. <br>
                     But Earth is also orbiting around the Sun, moving even faster: 67,000 miles per hour. And the Sun itself is moving around the center of our galaxy, carrying <br>
                      everything in the solar system with it, at a rate of 490,000 miles per hour. And that’s not all. Our galaxy, the Milky Way , is moving too—at a rate of 872,405 <br>
                      miles per hour. Our cluster of galaxies is moving too. And so is everything else in the universe.
